# FuturaDrive - Infotainment UI 🚗

`FuturaDrive` is a prototype of a modern vehicle infotainment interface, built entirely with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **React Router**. It simulates a digital dashboard for managing comfort, autonomy, diagnostics, settings, and more.


*A preview of the main dashboard of the FuturaDrive system.*

## 🎯 Core Features

The system is divided into main modules, each managing a specific aspect of the vehicle:

* **🏠 Dashboard:** The central hub with quick access to all main functions and an at-a-glance vehicle status.
* **🔋 Autonomy:** Displays remaining range, a range map, and consumption graphs (using `recharts`).
* **💨 Comfort:** Granular control over climate, seat heating/ventilation, and ambient lighting.
* **🩺 Diagnostics:** System status scanning, monitoring of "vitals" (temperatures, pressures), and test execution.
* **🔧 Service:** Displays maintenance history and upcoming service deadlines (check-ups, inspections).
* **👤 Profile:** User profile management and overall driving statistics.
* **🌿 Energy Saving:** Selection of driving modes (Eco, Normal, Sport) to optimize performance.
* **📡 Telemetry:** Recording and viewing driving session data.
* **⏱️ Intertime:** Monitors continuous driving time to manage breaks.
* **⚙️ Settings:** Configuration of system preferences (display, sound, connectivity).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is built using a modern and high-performance technology stack:

* **Frontend:** [React](https://reactjs.org/) (v18+)
* **Routing:** [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) (v6) for client-side navigation.
* **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a utility-first, responsive design system.
* **Icons:** [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) for lightweight and consistent SVG icons.
* **Charts:** [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) for consumption and autonomy graphs.
* **Build Tool:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (assumed) for a lightning-fast development experience.

```
/src
├── /components
│   ├── /layout       # Structural components (AppHeader, AppFooter)
│   └── /ui           # Atomic UI components (Card, Button, StatItem, ActionItem)
│
├── /constants
│   └── colors.js     # Centralized Tailwind color definitions (Theming)
│
├── /pages
│   ├── Dashboard.jsx # Main application pages
│   ├── Autonomy.jsx  # (and all other pages...)
│   └── ...
│
├── router.js         # Route definitions (React Router config)
├── App.jsx           # Root layout with Header, Footer, and Outlet
├── main.jsx          # Application entry point (React DOM)
└── index.css         # Global styles and Tailwind directives
```

---

## ✨ Best Practices Implemented

* **Clean Architecture:** Clear separation between `pages`, `layout`, and `ui` components.
* **Modern Routing:** Use of `createBrowserRouter` and `<Outlet>` from React Router 6.
* **Centralized Theming:** Tailwind classes are managed in `colors.js` to ensure visual consistency and easy theme updates.
* **Reusable Components:** Abstraction of UI logic into reusable components like `StatItem` and `ActionItem` to reduce code duplication.
* **Accessibility (a11y):** Use of `role` and `aria-*` attributes (e.g., in `ToggleSwitch`) to improve the experience for screen readers.
